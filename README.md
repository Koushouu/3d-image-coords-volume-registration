# 3d-image-coords-volume-registration
3D Image volume (\*.tif) and coordinates (\*.iv/\*.swc) registration project for Prof Chi-Hon Lee lab at ICOB, Academia Sinica

To get started, check  explanation_example.ipyb, where the detailed installation instruction was described.

In my opinion, the most useful function here is iv2swc.py, which converts iv file (used by old NIH software to save coordinates) to swc file (more up-to-date format to save coordinates).
